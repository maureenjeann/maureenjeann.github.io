  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a credit analyst and a working student currently pursuing my Master's in Business Administration at Ateneo Graduate School of Business. My professional journey is guided by strong values and a deep passion for continuous learning and growth. Balancing work and studies has not only strengthened my discipline and resilience but also sharpened my insights into business strategy and financial analysis. This website is a reflection of my commitment to personal and professional development, and a space to share my journey, connect, and grow.
